NOTE-WRITING WEBPAGE:
This webpage is created by using html,CSS and javascript only.

Here's what a user can do:
* A user can create a note by writing on the text area and when create on save button, it saves the note on the saved notes area.
* If nothing is written on the textarea and user clicks on save button, it shows an alert option.
* User can edit as well as dele the saved notes.
* User can remove all written text written in textarea by clicking on clear button.
Here's the issue:
You'll notice the tick mark on the right side of the note "âœ“" and still it is editable.
